# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I have keen interests in startups and technology. My greatest professional achievement thus far is being an ex-cofounder @ Scratchbac Pte Ltd where we raised 500k worth of seed funding building a community app. From being the first developer to having a team of 12 amazing people. I am sure the lessons learnt will stay with me as I embark on my next endeavors.
